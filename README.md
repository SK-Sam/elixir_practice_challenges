## Code Challenges

Trying to take on code challenges while upholding Functional Programming patterns and practices. I'm currently shooting for one challenge a day as I read [Elixir in Action by Saša Jurić](https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action)

## Purpose

I'd like to practice what I'm reading/studying in order to become more proficient in Functional Programming & Elixir. I'd like to push my projects towards Phoenix and be able to solve problems outside of the OOP realm.
